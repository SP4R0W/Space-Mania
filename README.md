# Space-Mania
This is my first game ever created in pygame. It was made in Summer 2019 and I think was written on python 3.7.2. Your goal is to shoot enemy spaceships and not get killed.

This game has no save system or any mission progression system (I didn't know how to do it back then lol) A new, remastered version of this game is coming under the name Galactic Wars. More info soon.

If you find any bugs, let me know either here or on Discord: xXx_Bain_xXx#1237
